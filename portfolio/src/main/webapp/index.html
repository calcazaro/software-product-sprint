      <p>Hello my name is Carlos Alcazar, I am 19 years old and am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at the University of Texas at El Paso.
        I was born in Memphis, Tennessee and shortly moved to El Paso, Texas and have been living here my whole life. Some of my favorite things to do is listening to music and watching films.</p>

      <div class="indent">
      <p>My enjoyment and appreciation for computer science started in middle school when I joined a Robotics club after school and we began to code our robots to traverse through
          obstacle courses that we built. Even though the coding was rudimentary, it got me to find the most efficient solution to the problem, which I later found out is vital in CS. Ever since
          then whenever there has been a Robotics course offered in my school I would take it to strengthen my problem solving skills, up until college where I would begin taking CS courses and learn 
          the traditional coding languages.
